# mte-ambassador-bd-journal
This is the digital home of “Bangladesh × A MTE Climate Journey,” a journal shaped during my time as a Max Thabiso Edkins Climate Ambassador. It holds raw thoughts, research, reflections, and grounded questions from Bangladesh, woven through ESHAleben PowerPods.
This journal series will expand with reflections on upcoming MTE sessions (Energy, Food, Climate Finance, etc.). Stay tuned for more updates.
